## Random Algorithms & Code Snippets

This repository is a collection of small coding experiments, algorithms, etc.  
It serves as a personal playground for learning, testing, and showcasing various (non-serious) things I've done.

## Repo Structure
The code is organized by topic in folders:
(will expand in the future to be more navigatable as repo grows)
/slot_machine_sort/ -> intentionally bad sorting algorithm I randomly thought of

**Notes:**
Projects currently are self-contained and can be run individually.
